H2CK21 Group-Assignment

Work report

We got a little short handed with time and started this assignment too late. There is 3 participants in our group, but we managed to get the program done in time. Everyone didnt contribute to the programming, but maintained presence through teams chat with ideas, general tips etc. Really there is not much to say about the process and it could have gone better. Summer is coming and finding time for everything and everyone is not easy.
